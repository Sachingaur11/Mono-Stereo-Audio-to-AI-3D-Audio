# Stereo to 3D Audio conversion

## Description

The Stereo to 3D Audio Conversion project is designed to transform standard stereo audio files into immersive 3D audio experiences. This project leverages advanced audio processing techniques and AI-driven 3D positioning to create a spatial audio effect that enhances the listener's experience.

### Key Features:

- **Audio Format Conversion**: Supports conversion between various audio formats, ensuring compatibility and flexibility.
- **3D Audio Effects**: Utilizes AI to generate realistic 3D positions for audio elements, including azimuth, elevation, and distance, creating a dynamic and engaging soundscape.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores and retrieves audio files using MongoDB and GridFS, facilitating efficient data management.
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large audio files by processing them in chunks, optimizing performance and resource usage.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to adjust parameters such as delay, attenuation, and distance to fine-tune the 3D audio effect.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading audio files and downloading processed outputs.

This project is ideal for developers and audio engineers looking to explore the potential of 3D audio in applications such as virtual reality, gaming, and immersive media.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Flask

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

   On Unix-like systems:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Set the Flask application environment variable**:

   On Unix-like systems:

   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   set FLASK_APP=app.py
   ```

2. **Run the Flask application**:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

3. **Access the application**:

   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view the application.
